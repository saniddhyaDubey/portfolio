          Iâ€™m a curios and adaptive backend/api developer who has spent the last
          1 year working on distributed systems, low level programming in C++, working on blockchain protocols
          and learning about scalable applications. I have been working with various talented individuals
          from all over the world, learning and growing with them. My
          out-of-the-box thinking and eagerness to dive into technologies has
          allowed me to become an extremely capable developer.
